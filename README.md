# API-Crypto

End-to-end project from pulling the data from an API all the way to cleaning, exploring, analysing and visualizing the data.  

Data pulled from [Coin Market API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Introduction) and automated to pull it repeteadly in a 1-minute timeframe, respecting the 333 daily pulls stablished in Coin Market documentation.

The objective is to analyse the value changes over time for the 10 most popular cryptocurrencies according to [NextAdvisor](https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/types-of-cryptocurrency/) + Binance US for personal reasons.

The entire project is still in progress, and you can find some of the steps and key findings [here](https://github.com/grazielladall/API-Crypto/blob/main/API%20TEST%20Notebook.ipynb)
